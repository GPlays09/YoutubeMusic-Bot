# YoutubeMusic-Bot
I am working on a bot that downloads whatever you are currently listening to on youtube music in your browser.

The bot will download the new track when the link of the tab changes so it will not download the first song you listen too
so I recommend starting it before you play and enlarge it.


Instructions: 

1. Open a browser Edge, Firefox, Opera
2. Go to https://music.youtube.com/ or (https://www.youtube.com/ - should work too)
3. Select whatever you want to play Track/ Playlist
4. Play it and enlarge it so that you see its thumbnail on the left of the screen not just in the bottom centre of your screen

like so:

and not like:

6. That's it, the bot will download new music to your local users directory (C:/Users/ ?? /Music)
